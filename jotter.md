**To compile code, use 'rustc main.rs'** <br>
_This creates the executable code file. then run;_<br>
**./main to run the code**

#### Nb

_Note: You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the cargo doc --open command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other functionality in the rand crate, for example, run cargo doc --open and click rand in the sidebar on the left._
